angular-keyboard
================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gampleman/angular-keyboard.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gampleman/angular-keyboard)

angular-keyboard is a user interface toolkit for adding declaratively keyboard navigation to your web apps.

Please see the [docs](http://code.gampleman.eu/angular-keyboard/) for more information.

Install
-------

Using bower:

```
bower install --save angular-keyboard-shortcuts
```

(The name is `angular-keyboard-shortcuts`, since `angular-keyboard` is taken by another project).

Features
--------

- Simple and declarative definition of keyboard shortcuts
- `mod` shorcut transforms to `command` on OSX and to `control` on other platforms
- Support for GMail style keyboard shortcut sequences
- Automatically generate help screen for currently available shortcuts
- Use the API to define shortcuts dynamically in your code
- Support for keyboard selection on collections and shortcuts for acting on current selection

Usage
-----

There is a number of ways to use angular-keyboard, but the simplest is probably to use the declarative approach:

~~~html
<a ng-click="goToPreferences()" keyboard-shortcut="control+,">Preferences</a>
~~~

If the user presses `control ,`, the `goToPreferences` function will be invoked.

You can add

~~~html
<keyboard-help></keyboard-help>
~~~

and this will be transformed into a user visible screen that shows the currently accessible keyboard shortcuts.

Kudos
-----

The code relies on the [Mousetrap library](https://github.com/ccampbell/mousetrap) by [Craig Campbell](http://craig.is/).
